# CCCI's Master Bible Reading Plan
The goal of this reading plan is to provide a manageable (two readings each weekday; one of those readings being a Psalm or Proverb) diet of Scripture which (a) reads through books (or large portions of books) and (b) reads the entire Bible over ~8 years.

Further, this plan focuses on a 4-year cycle (Years A, B, C, D) which corresponds to one main Gospel being read and preached at the beginning of each of those years. (This idea was adopted from the [Narrative Lectionary](https://www.workingpreacher.org/home-narrative-lectionary)). However, given the length of the Old Testament, there are alternating "sub-years" (e.g. - A1, B1, C1, D1, A2, B2, C3, D2).

The few books tagged "#E" and are to be inserted as able.

Finally, this reading plan aims to satisfy the three natural calendars (school, church, and solar) by starting in the Old Testament in September (school) in order to lead up to messianic prophecies in Advent (church) which in turn naturally flows into the in-depth study of one main Gospel beginning in January (solar).
